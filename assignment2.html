    <p>Install multiple web browsers to compare the different programs:

The activity I chose was to do was activity number two. For this activity I was instructed to install multiple web browsers to compare the different programs. The two web browsers I chose was Microsoft edge and google chrome.  I installed chrome on my laptop by accessing the google site for the downloads.  Microsoft edge was already pre-installed on my laptop, but I have never used it. I was utilizing Firefox and Opera. What I learned from performing this activity was that chrome browser was far more superior in edge in every way. I appreciated the look and feel of the chrome browser the way my bookmarks were organized and how easy it was to transfer my data from Firefox into the chrome browser. Edge was a little more sophisticated in performing the task of syncing if you didn’t have an outlook account. I envision utilizing the comparisons and differences of the two browsers in order to find one that could assist me best with what tasks I will need to do within the web. 
Practice using web browsers:

The second activity I chose to complete was activity 3. For Activity three I was instructed to practice using web browsers. There was a link to GCF global that instructed me to utilize the tips that were presented for each browser. I personally found a lot of usage in the privacy and security tips for google chrome since I utilize that web browser a lot. Most of the time for online shopping I will have to input a lot of sensitive information, so I found it useful to have those tips at hand. Such tips like how to know if a site is secure or not. I envision utilizing these tips when I must complete online shopping or filling out applications with sensitive information online so hackers don’t have an easy time stealing my information.
