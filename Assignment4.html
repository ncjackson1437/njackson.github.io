    <p>PART ONE:
For activity one, I was instructed to complete the tutorial on the TutorialsPoint Social networking site and with the information provided, decide on which of the social media sites interest me. The tutorial listed out which of the social networking sites were available and what their functions were and what you were able to do on them. Facebook for example is a really good social networking website for anyone that is into light online gaming and sharing photos. I learned about all of the utilities of social media by viewing this page and deciding which features of social media I would want, and which one would cater to those needs. I envision myself utilizing LinkedIn and Facebook mostly to stay connected with coworkers in my professional life. I use Facebook to stay connected to old classmates and family. I noticed that some of the rest of the social media are outdated and non-existent anymore such as google plus. 

For activity three I was asked to review the article on smart insights titled the honeycomb article. I had to evaluate each of the most popular social media sites based on their level of support for each of the honeycomb framework elements. I also had to check to see which sites support the honeycomb framework and are lacking some of the framework from the honeycomb structure as well. I learned that Facebook has mainly all of the honeycomb elements over the other social medias due to their ability to keep you on their website and in their application for as long as possible other social medias like to mainly focus on one are such as Pinterest where the main focus is on simply sharing pictures and not really connecting to other users. Even though there is a space for connecting with other users itâ€™s not really used that often for connecting as much as Facebook is known for that. Reddit is a lot more for people who want to remain anonymous and just have their content focused on. The presence aspect is lost on Pinterest and Reddit. I envision utilizing the honeycomb method to use when I am planning on figuring out what media I would want to utilize for specific social tasks or if I had to make my own social networking site. 

PART TWO

For activity 6 I was instructed to read an article form the RIAA about Privacy. I was also tasked with researching legal issues and potential penalties related to illegal peer to peer file sharing.  I learned that music theft does change with the advancement of technology, and it is good to keep abreast of it and stay aware of when you are infringing on copyright. The penalties for stealing music are quite harsh and it can include prison time up to five years if an individual is found guilty copyright infringement. I envision utilizing this information if I am ever creating something with music in order to not infringe on the original owner and to avoid penalties that were listed and informed of within the article.
