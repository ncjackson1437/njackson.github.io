    <p>What I learned about web development the internet and web development this semester, is that I need to make sure I maintain the best privacy I can on the internet. It is very easy for hackers and companies to get your information and sell it on the dark web in order to perform malicious acts with a userâ€™s data. I also realized during our security unit that a lot of people take how important their data is for granted. I have learned how to take proactive steps to secure my data before anything bad would happen. I have downloaded password managers and have educated myself about potential phishing threats through emails. This class was a very crucial step into having a deeper understanding into the inner workings of the internet from the inside out. </p>
