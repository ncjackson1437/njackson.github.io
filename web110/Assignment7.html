    <p>For Activity one I was asked to complete one or more of the following tutorials from a selection of websites. I chose the website Mozilla developer in order to acquire more knowledge on the subject.  I learned that HTML is specifically a markup language and not a programming language in which some people may be mistaken upon first impression of the language. I also was able to learn and note that tags are not case sensitive as is may be the case with other languages. In HTML it can be very diversified in the way that it is written in which the difficulty can be different for each developer who writes it as it can be customized to the developerâ€™s own way of writing the markup language. I envision utilizing HTML in order to help understand the anatomy of a website within my professional and personal use of the internet and my interactions with webpages. </p>
