    <p>Within activity one I was instructed to learn about internet safety. For this activity I was able to read the GCF tutorial and tips about internet safety. I learned how to avoid spam and phishing by making sure I was able to read and identify phishing and spam e-mails. I learned that spammers can use a fake e-mail to send out spam. I also learned that spammers will use false information. Or fake urgency in order to get you to send money or steal your information. Most likely these spam and phishing e-mails will utilize links. This activity taught me to use spam filters and report spam to my e-mail service provider. I envision utilizing the spam filters in my work and personal e-mail accounts to keep them organized and spam free. 
Within activity two I was instructed to practice web browser safety. For this activity I was able to review my browserâ€™s privacy settings. My preferred browser to use is google chrome. Google chrome has some great privacy settings like clearing your browsers setting or utilizing an incognito tab in order to not track your web browsing history which is good if you want to privately browse. Most browsers have this setting, but I find google to be my favorite with this setting. I envision utilizing this information when I am browsing on a public internet device or my own personal devices.
