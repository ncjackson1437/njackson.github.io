<p>My project will be about IT professional careers. The main objective of the project is to help the viewer understand their career options within the IT field and come to a greater understanding of the wide variety of careers within the Information technology field. The great thing about the IT field is that there is always more room for growth as you expand your field of knowledge. I will be creating a PowerPoint Presentation equipped with images and main points that will span the five minutes and go over the objectives and scopes of my topic. </p>
