    <p>Within activity two I was asked to create vector graphics, I learned that vector graphics utilize geometric shapes and lines in order to create an image. I completed the vector graphics tutorial to create a new vector graphics image. On vectr.com. I was able to create fun logo on the site which looked extremely cool. I like the way it looked which was more like a logo. It is a nicer style than other styles where all the lines were much more perfect and relaxed. It looked a lot more modernized and professional. Originally, I had issues figuring out to change the color of the objects on the platform but was then able to change this appropriately. I envision utilizing this information during my professional career. 
        For activity three, I was asked to use multimedia. Within the activity I was asked to review the Wikipedia article on the Wikipedia page for VLC media player and use it to play multimedia and audio video files. From this article Wikipedia page, I was able to see the instructions for how to download and install the VLC media player and understand how to utilize its functions effectively. I learned that I was able to view multiple different versions of media through this software.  I envision utilizing the VLC media player in my personal life and future career in order to view media effectively.
