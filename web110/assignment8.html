<h1>Assignment 8</h1>
<p>For Assignment 8 I was asked to utilize CSS in order to create this webpage.The lessons learned from assignment 8 while making a CSS file was very important for me to understand because it simplifies the HTML markup language which was learned in this lesson for why we must utilzie CSS from now on when creating a website. Ie nvision utilizing this information in my future career when I will have to understand how  awebsite is created and what goes into making one.  </p>
