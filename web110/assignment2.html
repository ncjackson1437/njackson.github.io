    <p>Install multiple web browsers to compare the different programs:

The activity I chose was to do was activity number two. For this activity I was instructed to install multiple web browsers to compare the different programs. The two web browsers I chose was Microsoft edge and google chrome.  I installed chrome on my laptop by accessing the google site for the downloads.  Microsoft edge was already pre-installed on my laptop, but I have never used it. I was utilizing Firefox and Opera. What I learned from performing this activity was that chrome browser was far more superior in edge in every way. I appreciated the look and feel of the chrome browser the way my bookmarks were organized and how easy it was to transfer my data from Firefox into the chrome browser. Edge was a little more sophisticated in performing the task of syncing if you didn’t have an outlook account. I envision utilizing the comparisons and differences of the two browsers in order to find one that could assist me best with what tasks I will need to do within the web. 
Practice using web browsers:

The second activity I chose to complete was activity 3. For Activity three I was instructed to practice using web browsers. There was a link to GCF global that instructed me to utilize the tips that were presented for each browser. I personally found a lot of usage in the privacy and security tips for google chrome since I utilize that web browser a lot. Most of the time for online shopping I will have to input a lot of sensitive information, so I found it useful to have those tips at hand. Such tips like how to know if a site is secure or not. I envision utilizing these tips when I must complete online shopping or filling out applications with sensitive information online so hackers don’t have an easy time stealing my information. Compare search engines: 

I completed activity two. Within this activity I was asked to compare search engines. I learned that the search engine that I prefer to use is chrome for efficiency, but I enjoy utilizing duck duck go for privacy. I learned that in the search engines that don’t track your searches the searches are a lot less biased than they would be for trackers such as Bing and google chrome. I envision being able to apply this concept for my internet safety since I prefer not to be tracked and I enjoy having less biased results when I’m looking for news sources or researching for school or for my personal knowledge. 


Cite a webpage: 

I completed activity six. Within activity six I was instructed to cite a webpage. I learned that there are several different citation styles that the search engines can do. Most of the styles contain the same information just in different orders. It all really depends on what occasion you’re citing for which format you’re going to want to be using. Such APA is usually for college papers and can contain the link of the website that would be cited. Most of the time I have used MLA format for most of my schooling unless an instructor has told me otherwise.  I envision utilizing these citation methods for schooling or probably my work career.
